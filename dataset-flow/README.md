# NAV-NF Workflow

1. Extract landmarks from the instructions in the REVERIE dataset.
    ```
    python3 get_landmark.py
    ```

2. Classify each instruction based on the presence of identified landmarks into either `has_landmark` or `no_landmark`
    ```
    python3 split_to_subtask.py
    ```

3. Based on the classification result from Step 2, we adopt different exploration strategies for the `has_landmark` and `no_landmark` groups to generate the ground-truth paths
    ```
    python3 get_gt_path.py
    python3 get_gt_path_room.py
    ```

4. We use an LLM-based Rewriter to replace the target object in the original navigation instruction. To ensure that the new target object is not present in the room, we verify its absence using a GLIP-based Verifier. This process enables us to generate new navigation instructions with unreachable targets
    ```
    cd GLIP
    python3 gpt_generation_instruction.py
    ```

5. We merge the instruction-path pairs generated by the two different strategies and perform dataset splitting to construct the final NAV-NF dataset
    ```
    python3 final.py && python3 final_merge.py
    ```
